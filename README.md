# Flask Practice
- Will be following along with Digital Ocean tutorials for building Flask applications
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/#user-s-guide) is a Python-based web framework that is more minimal than Django
    - Flask depends on the [Jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) template engine and the [Werkzeug](https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/) WSGI toolkit
- It is the basis for [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/index.html), which is "a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application"
- Superset may be a good alternative to cBioPortal as a way to visualize the cBioPortal data

## Tutorial 1: [How To Make a Web Application Using Flask in Python 3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3#conclusion)

### Introduction
- This tutorial will use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling, [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) as a template engine, an [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) for its database

### Step 1 â€” Installing Flask
- Start by creating a conda environment (`flask_blog`) and installing Flask
```
conda create --name flask_blog python=3.7 (if environment doesn't already exist)
conda install --name flask_blog flask
conda activate flask_blog
conda deactivate flask_blog
```
